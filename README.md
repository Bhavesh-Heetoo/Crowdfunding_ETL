# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

# Overview
The following repository was created for the ETL mini project. For this project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and dictionary methods to extract, transform, and load the data. We created four CSV files from the transformed data, designed an ERD, defined a table schema, and loaded the data into a Postgres database.


# How to Run
   1. Clone the repository:
       1. Open your terminal (Git Bash, Command Prompt, or any Git client).
       2. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
       3. Run the following command to clone the repository: git clone link_provided
  2. Ensure Pandas , datetime , json and NumPy is installed/imported on your machine.
     - Install Pandas using pip if it's not already installed (pip install pandas).
     - Import datetime using from datetime import datetime if not done already i (from datetime import datetime as dt).
     - Install NumPy using pip if it's not already installed (pip install numpy).
     - Import json using import json if not done already (import json).
  3. Open the cloned file in the Visual Studio Code:
       1. Go to file > Open Folder and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.
       2. Select the folder to open in VS code.
  4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
     1. Open the notebook file (ETL_Mini_Project_JJiang_BHeetoo_TZubi.ipynb) in VS code or Jupyter.
     2. Run the cells.
